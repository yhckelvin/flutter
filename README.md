# time_tracker_flutter_course

A new Flutter project.
Hi, if you are learning from Andrea flutter time tracker.

You found that it is using flutter old version where raised button is used.

Hence, I have learned and used elevated button instead of raised button for reusable coding.

Praise God it is finally solved for reusable coding.
